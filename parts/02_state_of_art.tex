\chapter{State of art}

Collecting feedback for software projects is of course not something new. There a dozen of different solutions and way more open source and commercial services available then one can count.

This systems range from simple contact forms, which send out an email to the provider, to chat bots and sophisticated ticketing system, with in depth dashboards, visualizing how good the feedback system itself works...

In this chapter I'll present some of the most popular solutions and compare them to each other and also pointing out how good it would work with Aurora.
