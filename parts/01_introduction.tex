\chapter{Introduction}

Getting feedback for a software system is one of the most important tasks, since it gives insights if the implemented system works, if there are any bugs and also how the system could be improved.

\section{Motivation/Problem statement}

% todo: figure out how long aurora has been in use.
For the last \emph{n} years the learning platform Aurora has been used by 100(?) of students for several courses at the Vienna University of Technology. The system was originally implemented by students for the master thesis(?) and has been improved by other students.

A system with so created by so many different persons naturally introduces new bugs, which are hard to track, since a often the not the original author, but a different student might have to fix it.

In the past an online notebook has been used to keep track of different issues and features request for the aurora system. Every year a new notebook was created and people could freely add bugs and feature requests to it. This method of getting feedback came at high cost though:

The notebook would get cluttered within the first weeks and keeping it organized, meant that someone had to constantly moderate the notebook.
People would often add the same issue, since it was hard to find existing issues.
As soon as an issue was fixed, the issue had to be found in the notebook and somehow marked as such. 


\section{Aim of work}

The aim of this thesis was to find a solution to collect feedback efficiently, without the high moderation cost and still give users feedback about the state of there issue.

Since the system is a collaborative learning platform, ...

The last requirement was to find a system that could be integrated directly into aurora. Using an external, where users would have to create a separate account, ...
